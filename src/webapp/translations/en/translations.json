For data extracted from publications, please note that when the values of relevant variables were not directly provided in the publications or were analyzed differently than recommended by WHO, values were calculated from the reported data. WHO has made a best effort to geolocate all the studies for which coordinate were not provided or wrong coordinates were provided. However, precise coordinates could not always be found.
