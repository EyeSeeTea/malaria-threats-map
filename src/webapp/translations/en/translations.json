The vast majority of RDTs manufactured, procured and used around the world are based on detection of HRP2 either alone or in combination with other antigens (such as parasite lactate dehydrogenase or aldolase).",
            "part3": "However, in 2010 a study sponsored by WHO and FIND found that some <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites in Peru lacked the <i>pfhrp2</i> gene.

WHO recommends a change to an RDT that is not exclusively based on HRP2 for <i>P. falciparum</i> detection (ie. pf-pLDH) if the prevalence of false negative RDTs due to <i>pfhrp2</i> deletion is ≥ 5% amongst symptomatic patients.",
